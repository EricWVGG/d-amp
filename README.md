## iOS Safari extension for forwarding away from AMP websites

AMP has been a thorn in my butt for several years now. 

Like many others, I eventually bailed from Google on my iPhone and switched to Duck-Duck-Go. The problem is, DDG is pretty good for the stuff I do on my computer (technical documentation and discussions, professional stuff), it’s awful for stuff I do on my phone (highly local searches, restaurant and entertainment, etc.). I have been itching for Safari Extensions support on iOS for years now, and when I heard that it was finally here, dove into this project.

And got beat to the market by https://overamped.app. Which in turn was beat to market by https://amplosion.app. hmph.

For the record, of the three of us, my app has the best name.

Anyway, I had a bit of fun writing this. The design is inspired by Tab Cola, not for any real reason, it was just sort of on my mind. I had some fun playing with inertial special effects (look real closely at the "shine" on the background, it rolls in your hand like a soda can).

I am releasing the source this mostly because the documentation for Web Extensions is not great, so hopefully someone can pick up from what I managed to figure out.
